### intro
It is a simple restaurant searching website that utilizes Google map API to locate where the restaurant at, and a simple function that helps the user to decide what they would eat by randomly drawing a food.

### Dev tools
1. React JS
2. vscode

### Database
Since I don't familiar with some backend frameworks, so, I just hardcode the data of restaurants in JSON file in another repository on my GitHub and use the API method to fetch data to my app.
